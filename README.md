# Copy of Replicate's colab for finetuning SDXL

## Preparing Your Data

Before you start fine-tuning the SDXL model, you need to prepare your training data:

1. Gather all your training photos into one directory.
2. Compress this directory into a ZIP file named `data.zip`.

Copy that `data.zip` file to a colab session to generate a URL and start the fine-tuning process.
